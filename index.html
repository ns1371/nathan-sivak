  <p>My name is Nathan Sivak and I am a Junior at Miami University. I am from Cleveland, Ohio where I grew up with my sister,
    mom, and dad. Growing up, I had three dogs, a bunch of fish, and a turtle named Rocky. Two weeks ago, I got my first hamster
    named Jade who lives with me in my off campus apartment. She is a black and white Syrian Hamster who loves broccoli.
    I am currently majoring in Software Engineering with a General Business minor. In the past, I was involved with Miami's
    Stage Left club and was in their 2019 show, "Pippin". Currently, I am a member of the Miami Martial Arts Club where we train
     in traditional Taekwondo, Hapkido, and Judo. I am also an assistant instructor at my karate school back home where I have
     been training in traditonal Taekwondo, Hapkido, and Kickboxing for over eight years.</p>
